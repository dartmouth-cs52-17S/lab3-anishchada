The environment I set up was a one that utilized the Webpack build tool and the Node package manager. These tools help manage build modules that have numerous dependencies, and run JS outside of the browser. The environment uses Babel as a "transpiler" and Eslint as a code error parser to make sure the Javascript is error free and industry standard. I had a basic HTML and CSS file set up, and an organized directory with src and build subdirectories. The Node server was easy to run with the HTML/CSS/JS components.

In this lab, I used the React framework in order to design a page that utilized a component model and React data flows in order to allow for live note editing. I used Firebase to create a live backend that persisted all changes in real time.

The firebase part was quite difficult for me to get correct.

I owe a lot to Tim, as well as all the TAs that helped me, including Jon, Ahsan, and Alma. I made it to every office hours and help hours for this lab assignment and they helped me tremendously in completing the project as well as understanding the logic of React at a better level
